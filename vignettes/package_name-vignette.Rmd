This R package is for calculation of BMI (body mass index), and some more computations based on weight loss goals. The package provides simple answers to a user's weight loss goals in terms of how much weight loss/gain and calorie deficit/increase should be aimed for with a target weight and time frame in mind. The package also provides helpful visualizations about BMI and calorie intake change trajectory leading to the target.

This document introduces you to bmi.calculatorâ€™s basic set of tools, and shows you how to use them. 

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

## Installation

You can install the development version of bmi.calculator from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/bmi-calculator-r")
```

## Functions

The package contains the following functions

-   `calculate_bmi`: computes user's BMI based on weight and height. Also creates a visual of the BMI on scale
-   `project_bmi`: computes how much average change in BMI should be achieved per week given a targeted weight and the timeframe to reach the goal. Also presents a visual trajectory for BMI
-   `project_calories`: computes how much average calorie intake is ideal per week given a targeted weight and the timeframe to reach the goal. Also presents a visual trajectory for calories
-   `exercise_plan`: suggests possible exercise plans to achieve the targeted weight. Also gives a graph showing how much exercise of each kind is needed per day

## Example

To use the package, load the package library with following command:

```{r import}
library(bmi.calculator)
```

To use the functions, see examples below:

### Calculate BMI

```{r example1, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
# Weight 100kg, height 1.85 meters, BMI value returned.
calculate_bmi(100, 1.85, return_graph=FALSE)

# Weight 100kg, height 1.85 meters, BMI graph returned.
calculate_bmi(100, 1.85, return_graph=TRUE)
```

### Compute average BMI change per week

```{r example2, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
# Weight 100kg, height 1.85 meters, BMI goal 25, 30 days to reach goal, return average BMI change per week. 
project_bmi(100, 1.85, 25, 30, return_graph=FALSE)

# Weight 100kg, height 1.85 meters, BMI goal 25, 30 days to reach goal, return plot of Projected BMI trajectory. 
project_bmi(100, 1.85, 25, 30, return_graph=TRUE)
```

### Compute caloric intake per day based in a target weight

```{r example3, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
# Weight 100kg, height 1.85 meters, male, 25 years old, moderate exercise 3-5 times a week, ideal weight 75kg, 
# 25 days to reach goal, return caloric intake per day based in a target weight. 
project_calories(100, 1.85, 1, 25, 1.6, 75, 25, return_graph=FALSE)

# Weight 100kg, height 1.85 meters, male, 25 years old, moderate exercise 3-5 times a week, ideal weight 75kg, 
# 25 days to reach goal, return plot of Projected Weight Loss. 
project_calories(100, 1.85, 1, 25, 1.6, 75, 25, return_graph=TRUE)
```

### Create an exercise plan

```{r example4, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
# Weight 100kg, height 1.83 meters, female, aged 27
# Target weight: 68kg in 30 days
exercise_plan(100, 1.83, 2, 27, 68, 30)

# Weight 100kg, height 1.83 meters, female, aged 27
# Target weight: 68kg in 30 days
# But this time, a graph instead:
exercise_plan(100, 1.83, 2, 27, 68, 30, return_graph=TRUE)
```
