Description: This package is for calculation of BMI (body mass index),
    and some more computations based on weight loss goals. The package provides
    simple answers to a user's weight loss goals in terms of how much weight
    loss/gain and calorie deficit/increase should be aimed for with a target
    weight and time frame in mind. The package also provides helpful
    visualizations for these questions.
