\arguments{
\item{weight}{A numeric number of body weight value.}

\item{height}{A numeric number of height value.}

\item{return_graph}{TRUE or FALSE on whether to return a graphical
visualization instead of a bmi value.}

A numeric number of body mass index value.

A numeric number of body mass index value.
}
\description{
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a calculated measure of weight relative to height,
defined as body weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared
(Keys et al., 1972). If \code{return_graph} is \code{TRUE}, an
ggplot object is returned instead of a bmi value.
