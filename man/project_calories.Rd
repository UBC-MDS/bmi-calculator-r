\title{Calculate caloric intake per day based in a target weight. Assumption is
that the goal is losing weight rather than gaining weight.}
\usage{
project_calories(
  weight,
  height,
  sex,
  age,
  pal,
  target_weight,
  number_of_days,
  return_graph = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{weight}{A numeric number of current weight in kilograms (kg).}

\item{height}{A numeric number of current height in meters (m).}

\item{sex}{A numeric number for sex, used in the Harrisâ€“Benedict equation estimation,
1 for male and 2 for female}

\item{age}{A numeric number for current age in years.}

\item{pal}{A numeric number for physical activity level, can only be one of the four listed values:
1.2 for "Little/no exercise"
1.4 for "Light exercise 1-3 times a week"
1.6 for "Moderate exercise 3-5 times a week"
1.75 for "Hard exercise 3-5 times a week"}

\item{target_weight}{A numeric number for weight goal to be achieved in number_of_days}

\item{number_of_days}{A numeric number for number of days allotted to achieve target_weight}

\item{return_graph}{TRUE or FALSE on whether to return a graphical visualization instead of a caloric intake value.}
}
\value{
A float or a ggplot visualization. If \code{return_graph} is \code{False}, returns a float specifying caloric intake
divided by the number of days. If \code{return_graph} is \code{True}, returns a straight line graph of projected
weight loss per day.
}
\description{

that the goal is losing weight rather than gaining weight.
